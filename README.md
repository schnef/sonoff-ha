# sonoff-ha #

Control a Sonoff Basic switch from HomeAssistant.

This implementation is kept simple. It uses a TLS based MQTT client to
communicate with HA. The status of the switch is published on topic
`sonoff/relay` and it subscribes to topic `sonoff/relay/set` for
`on`/`off` commands. The client id has the form `sonoff-XXXXXX` with
the ESP8266's chip id as the last six characters.

HA configuration:

```
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "sonoff-XXXXXX"
    command_topic: "sonoff/relay/set"
    state_topic: "sonoff/relay"
    payload_on: "on"
    payload_off: "off"
```

Pressing the button on the Sonoff switch for more than 5 seconds will
reboot the device.

Don't forget to use signed OTA updates as described
